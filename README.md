# CC2530_based_simple_RBS_and_TPSN_application
Seperately apply simple RBS and TPSN on three CC2530 nodes
Tools required: IVR, ZStack-CC2530-2.5.1a, Three CC2530 modules with Webee extension boards

When ZStack-CC2530-2.5.1a installed,
you can go to directory ZStack-CC2530-2.5.1a\Projects\zstack\Samples\SampleApp\Source,
and find a C source file called SampleApp.c. This file is where I did most changes.
You may delete SampleApp.c and rename the files in this repository as SampleApp.c.
Then you can run it in IVR and burn into the CC2530.
